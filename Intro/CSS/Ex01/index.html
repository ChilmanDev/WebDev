                    <p>
                        The Scream is the popular name given to a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893 and 1910.
                        The German title was Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature).
                        The works show a figure with an agonized expression against a landscape with a tumultuous orange sky.
                        Arthur Lubow has described The Scream as "an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time".
                    </p>

                        Edvard Munch created the four versions if various media.
                        The National Gallery in Oslo, Norwaym holds one of the two painted versions (1893, shown here).
                        The Munch Museum holds the other painted version (1910, see gallery, below) and a pastel version from 1893.
                        These three versions have not traveled for years.
